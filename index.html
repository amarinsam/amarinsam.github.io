<b>Grid</b>
Jotting down a few CSS rules for those newbs out there -- just feel like while this knowledge is rather rote, and not specifically algorithmic/design decision challenges, it's nevertheless important to know as knowing some of these basics can help optimize your time so you aren't sinking countless hours guessing and checking your css.  I'd recommend always adding a border: 1px solid red to your elements so you can see your layout boundaries while building.</p>
<p>
<p>
Grid: Parent component for all layouts.  For all Grids, you'll generally want to have a display: grid or inline-grid property, position: relative property, grid-template-rows property, and width: 100% and height: 100% properties.
</p>
display: inline-grid stacks all cells vertically.<br></br>  
display: grid will stack them horizontally.  For my comparison module, I went with inline-grid.<br></br>
grid-template-rows: auto auto auto 1fr declares 4 rows, which behave a bit different.  auto 3 times means that the first 3 elements will stack up on top of or next to each other, and 1fr means the last cell takes up all remaining avialable space.  1fr means 100% of available space.  Each declaration of a new property (i.e., auto, <number>fr) adds another row to your grid.<br></br>  
position: relative lets you position all child elements relative to their containing element (i.e., all children become relative to the parent, the parent containing the position: relative attribute).<br></br>
position: absolute is best for children, when you want to lay them out within a container.  I generally use this for all children elements within my grid container div.  position: absolute, allows you to access functionality like overlapping elements on top of one another.<br></br>
height: 100%, width: 100% allows any containing elements to set their sizing relative to this parent grid container.<br></br>
</p>
</p>
<b>Flex</b>
<p>For all rows/columns in your grid, you'll generally want to have Row divs be container elements for Column divs.<br></br>
The Rows will have a display:flex property, have a flex-direction: row property.<br></br>
The Columns will have a flex: integer property, which tells you proportionally, how much space each column will take up, relative to the entire width of the Row flex div.<br></br>
</p>
<b>Rows</b><br></br>
display: flex will tell CSS to use flex properties/methods when rendering this element<br></br>
For a row, you'd likely want to implement a flex-direction: row property.  A basic template for a flex row would be as follows:<br></br>
flex-direction: row lets you setall containing elements along an X-axis<br></br>
width: 100% lets your flex row take up 100% of all available space
height: 'auto' or 'fit-content' 
<ul> 
<li>'auto' will set a div's height to be the height of it's content -- if the content height exceeds the container height, it will expand.</li>
<li>'fit-content' will limit the container height to what's allowed by it's parent container.  I need to test this, but in reading, 'fit-content' may force the element to expand to fit available space, if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<b>Columns</b><br></br>
For your columns, you'll generally want implement a flex: number property, and a height and width property.<br></br>
flex: number tells CSS to give the column a width relationally sized to all other columns in your parent Row.  With a Row containing 3 Columns -> Column A: flex: 1, Column B: flex: 2, Column C: flex: 1, makes all columns fill available space, and gives column B twice the with of Columns A and C.<br></br>
height and width should be set, in order to control how they take up available space (100%, or some specific percentage).
</p>

<h4>Engineering challenges</h4>
<b>Completed</b>
<ul>
<li>Related products module contains *only* items with similar category</li>
<li>User can scroll left/right through related products module using only buttons</li>
<li>Comparison modal utilizes grid + flexbox layout</li>
<li>Comparison modal aggregates compared product features, and each product gets a check mark next to the feature name if it matches that feature.</li>
<li>Comparison modal only displays upon clicks of unique related products</li>
</ul>
I made some decisions regarding the feature 'checkmark' algorithm, where I decided to aggregate features from both items into a single list, rather than maintaining two separate lists.  Even though this involved creating additional variables and additional functions, this will make my code could be easier to understand and easily modified by another developer in the future.<br></br>
I originally declared a scroll handler function within my related products module but Because both the related products module and outfits list need to be scrollable, I ended up refactoring my code and moving this helper function into a shared folder so that it may be reusable by both components.<br></br>

<h2>3/5 -</h2> 
I was reminded today of a few key things:
<br></br>
<b>UseEffect:</b> 
Making sure to pair useEffect with setState functions, (passing in the state variable into the dependency array), if you need to do something AFTER the state variable is updated.  
<br></br>
<b>Array.map vs Array.forEach:</b>
.map is best used when you want to transform every element in an array, and return a new array of the same length.<br></br>
.forEach works better if you want to add elements to a new array based on whether an element meets a certain condition.
<br></br>
<b>To Do:</b>
Study CSS:
Position: absolute vs relative vs fixed
</p>
<p>
<h2>3/4 -</h2> 
<br></br>
<b>Async/await:</b>
Today I learned how to implement async/await - works with async functions that return promises
<br></br>
<b>Styled Components:</b>
Styled components are a great and easy way to build components, and have those components have CSS (that you define) prebaked into those components.  It helps a lot to, while building a basic skeleton, to get visual feedback on how your build will render.  I also find it a bit easier to use than managing CSS in a separate style sheet.  I just find that the CSS fits better together with React's comonent-based architecture.

2/29 - 
Some recaps from the last few days<br></br>
<b>Module Specifications</b>
<br></br>
I'm working on the 'related products' and 'your outfits' module.  I've tried many times in the past to get a working ecommerce site working from scratch, and I've never been able to do it.  I'm looking forward to nailing it this time.  
<br></br>
Today we nailed down a great process for working with Git and Github -- namely, how we want to work with a develoment branch, our workflow for working off of individual feature branches, and how we're going to pull changes down before making commits, and how we're going to push to different remotes (feature branches). 
</p>
<p>
<b>New Configurations</b>
We are following the Airbnb style guide for this project.  Our next steps are configuring the dotenv library, and beginning our preliminary sprint to nail down the skeleton for our project.
</p>
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
2/28 - Initializing an app
We initialized our app from scratch:
- Creating a package.json file with npm init -y
- Configured Webpack, Babel, React, Styled Components, Jest, ESlint
- Decided on Git workflow and other general project guidelines/expectations 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
2/27 - First day with our project teams

I'm going to make sure that I always edit this file!
