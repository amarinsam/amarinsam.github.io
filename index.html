Hello World
This is written in Vim

2/28 - Initializing an app
We initialized our app from scratch:
- Creating a package.json file with npm init -y
- Configured Webpack, Babel, React, Styled Components, Jest, ESlint
- Decided on Git workflow and other general project guidelines/expectations 

2/27 - First day with our project teams

I'm going to make sure that I always edit this file!
