2/29 - 
Some recaps from the last few days<br></br>
<b>Module Specifications</b>
<br></br>
I'm working on the 'related products' and 'your outfits' module.  I've tried many times in the past to get a working ecommerce site working from scratch, and I've never been able to do it.  I'm looking forward to nailing it this time.  
<br></br>
Today we nailed down a great process for working with Git and Github -- namely, how we want to work with a develoment branch, our workflow for working off of individual feature branches, and how we're going to pull changes down before making commits, and how we're going to push to different remotes (feature branches). 
</p>
<p>
<b>New Configurations</b>
We are following the Airbnb style guide for this project.  Our next steps are configuring the dotenv library, and beginning our preliminary sprint to nail down the skeleton for our project.

2/28 - Initializing an app
We initialized our app from scratch:
- Creating a package.json file with npm init -y
- Configured Webpack, Babel, React, Styled Components, Jest, ESlint
- Decided on Git workflow and other general project guidelines/expectations 
</p>

2/27 - First day with our project teams

I'm going to make sure that I always edit this file!
