I was reminded today of a few key things:
<br></br>
<b>UseEffect:</b> 
Making sure to pair useEffect with setState functions, (passing in the state variable into the dependency array), if you need to do something AFTER the state variable is updated.  
<br></br>
<b>Array.map vs Array.forEach:</b>
.map is best used when you want to transform every element in an array, and return a new array of the same length.<br></br>
.forEach works better if you want to add elements to a new array based on whether an element meets a certain condition.
<br></br>
<b>To Do:</b>
Study CSS:
Position: absolute vs relative vs fixed
</p>

<br></br>
<b>Async/await:</b>
Today I learned how to implement async/await - works with async functions that return promises
<br></br>
<b>Styled Components:</b>
Styled components are a great and easy way to build components, and have those components have CSS (that you define) prebaked into those components.  It helps a lot to, while building a basic skeleton, to get visual feedback on how your build will render.  I also find it a bit easier to use than managing CSS in a separate style sheet.  I just find that the CSS fits better together with React's comonent-based architecture.

2/29 - 
Some recaps from the last few days<br></br>
<b>Module Specifications</b>
<br></br>
I'm working on the 'related products' and 'your outfits' module.  I've tried many times in the past to get a working ecommerce site working from scratch, and I've never been able to do it.  I'm looking forward to nailing it this time.  
<br></br>
Today we nailed down a great process for working with Git and Github -- namely, how we want to work with a develoment branch, our workflow for working off of individual feature branches, and how we're going to pull changes down before making commits, and how we're going to push to different remotes (feature branches). 
</p>
<p>
<b>New Configurations</b>
We are following the Airbnb style guide for this project.  Our next steps are configuring the dotenv library, and beginning our preliminary sprint to nail down the skeleton for our project.

2/28 - Initializing an app
We initialized our app from scratch:
- Creating a package.json file with npm init -y
- Configured Webpack, Babel, React, Styled Components, Jest, ESlint
- Decided on Git workflow and other general project guidelines/expectations 
</p>
<br></br>
<p>
2/27 - First day with our project teams

I'm going to make sure that I always edit this file!
